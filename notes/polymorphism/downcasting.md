# ⬇︎ Downcasting

---

## 🧠 What is Downcasting?

### 📌 Definition:

> **Downcasting** is when a **parent class reference** is **explicitly cast back** to a **child class reference**.

✅ Required when you want to access **child-specific features** after upcasting.  
❌ But it **can throw `ClassCastException`** at runtime if not done carefully.

---

## 🔧 Syntax

```java
Parent p = new Child();    // ✅ Upcasting
Child c = (Child) p;       // 👈 Downcasting
```

---

## 🧬 Example

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Generic Animal Sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Dog fetches ball 🎾");
    }
}
```

### ✅ Downcasting:

```java
Animal a = new Dog();      // Upcasting
Dog d = (Dog) a;           // ✅ Downcasting
d.fetch();                 // Dog fetches ball 🎾
```

### ❌ Unsafe Downcasting:

```java
Animal a = new Animal();
Dog d = (Dog) a; // ❌ Runtime Error: ClassCastException
```

---

## ⚠️ How to Prevent ClassCastException?

👉 Use `instanceof` before downcasting:

```java
if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a;
    d.fetch();
}
```

✅ Safe check before casting.

## 🎯 Why Use Downcasting?

| ✅ Reason                           | 📘 Description                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Access child-only methods          | After upcasting, use child-specific behavior  |
| Needed in some frameworks          | Spring/Hibernate/JDBC sometimes need it       |
| Works with polymorphic collections | e.g. `List<Object>` → downcast to actual type |

---

## 🧪 Full Example

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void jump() {
        System.out.println("Cat jumps 🐱");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Cat();       // Upcasting
        a.makeSound();              // Cat's overridden method

        if (a instanceof Cat) {
            Cat c = (Cat) a;        // ✅ Safe Downcasting
            c.jump();               // Cat jumps 🐱
        }
    }
}
```

## ⚔️ Upcasting vs Downcasting

| Feature           | Upcasting 🆙   | Downcasting ⬇️                     |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Direction         | Child → Parent | Parent → Child                     |
| Cast required?    | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes (explicit)                   |
| Safe by default?  | ✅ Always safe  | ❌ Can fail at runtime              |
| Polymorphism      | ✅ Enables it   | ❌ Used to access specific features |
| Risk of exception | ❌ No risk      | ⚠️ ClassCastException possible     |

## 🧱 Real-World Analogy

> **Animal = General Ticket 🎟️**,  
> **Dog = VIP Pass 🎫**  
> You can **treat VIP as general (upcast)**, but to use VIP features, you need to **show proof (downcast carefully)**.

## 🛑 Common Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake                     | ⚠️ Issue                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| No `instanceof` check         | May lead to `ClassCastException` |
| Trying to downcast wrong type | Always fails at runtime          |
| Forgetting cast               | Compile-time error               |

## 🏁 Summary Table

| Feature             | Value                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type                | Explicit cast (Parent → Child)          |
| Safety              | Risky — use `instanceof` before casting |
| Required when?      | Accessing child-specific methods        |
| Default behavior?   | Not allowed — must be done manually     |
| Used in frameworks? | ✅ Yes, especially reflection-based ones |
